# Quiz Game (Python CLI)

## Overview:
This is a simple **Quiz Game** created using Python's **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** principles.  
The game asks the user multiple-choice questions, provides instant feedback, and shows the final score at the end.

## Features:
- 10 pre-defined multiple-choice Python questions
- OOP concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and methods
- CLI-based game, easy and fun to play
- Validates user input
- Option to replay the quiz

## OOP Concepts Used:
- **Class**: Blueprint for creating `Question` and `QuizGame`.
- **Object**: Instances of questions and the quiz itself.
- **Encapsulation**: Each class handles its own data and behavior.
- **Methods**: Functions like `ask()`, `start()`, and `play()` inside classes.
- **Instantiation**: Creating objects from classes.

## How to Run:
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file named `quiz_game.py`.
3. Open terminal/command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the game using the following command:

```bash
python quiz_game.py
